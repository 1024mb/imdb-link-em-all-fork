# Fork of IMDb: Link 'em all! by buzz

## Principal (only) changes from original script:

* Splitted ThePirateBay tracker into two to differentiate HD Movies and TV Shows results. Now it only searches for HD content and sorts results by size.
* Changed Rarbg site to rarbgweb.org and added parameters to only search for TV Shows and Movies, although this wasn't exactly necessary I added it just in case.
* Changed RuTracker to only search in TV Shows and Movies categories and sort results by size (asc. to desc.) by default.
* Added two subtitles websites for Spanish language (Subdivx and Argenteam). Subdivx is set to sort results by last uploaded (date).
* Added some spaces before every title for aestethics purposes (I just didn't liked how it looked).
