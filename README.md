# Fork of IMDb: Link 'em all! by buzz

## Principal (only) changes from original script

* ThePirateBay tracker has been split into two to differentiate HD Movies and TV Shows results. Now it only searches for HD content and sorts results by size.
* Changed Rarbg website to rarbgweb.org and added parameters to only search for TV Shows and Movies, although this wasn't exactly necessary I added it just in case. Also sorted results by size (desc.)
* Changed RuTracker to only search in TV Shows and Movies categories and sort results by size (desc.) by default.
* Added two subtitle websites for Spanish language (Subdivx and aRGENTeaM). Subdivx is set to sort results by last uploaded (date). It currently has some issues with some titles and special characters.
* Added some spaces before every title for aestethics purposes (I just didn't liked how it looked).
